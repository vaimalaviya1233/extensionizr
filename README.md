Another *izr? When will this stop
---------------------------------
Extensionizr is a simple way to jump start your chrome extension development. Just select the type of extension you want, choose permissions and youre off.

Why does this exist?
--------------------
Because I got super tired creating the file structure for a new extension over and over again. 
Extensionizr will be always updated with the latest chrome manifest changes. 
In addition, I wanted to create a client-side only tool. Extensionizr doesn't user server side code! Don't believe me? Checkout the github repo.

Based on open source
--------------------
Extensionizr is 90% based on open source pieces I put together. 
It's heavily inspired by Initializr by Jonathan Verrecchia.
